## Introduction
Understanding regression analysis is crucial for predictive modeling. This repository is designed to help you grasp key concepts related to handling missing values, conducting correlation analysis, and building simple linear regression models. Additionally, it covers the estimation of model parameters, computing R² and adjusted R², and interpreting the model results.

## Content
The repository includes the following components:

1. **Handling Missing Values:** Explore techniques and best practices for dealing with missing data before conducting regression analysis.

2. **Correlation Analysis:** Understand the relationships between variables through correlation analysis, a vital step in model building.

3. **Simple Linear Regression:** Implement and analyze simple linear regression models, estimating parameters and evaluating model performance.

4. **R² and Adjusted R²:** Learn how to compute R² and adjusted R² to assess the goodness of fit of your regression model.

5. **Model Interpretation:** Gain insights into interpreting regression models and understanding the implications of your findings.
